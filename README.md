> The ultimate federated entry point for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem.

`McpFederationGateway` is a high-performance, **Native AOT-compiled** .NET 10 service that acts as a reverse proxy and aggregator for multiple upstream MCP servers. It provides a unified interface for agents, reduces context consumption through smart aggregation, and bridges the gap between local (Stdio) and remote (SSE/HTTP) environments.

## ✨ Why MCP Federation Gateway?

### 🏢 Enterprise-Ready MCP Infrastructure

Running MCP servers directly from AI agents creates significant challenges for enterprises:

- **💰 Token Cost Explosion**: Every MCP server exposes full tool documentation to the LLM context. With 10+ servers, you can easily consume 50K+ tokens just listing available tools. **The gateway reduces this by up to 40%** through intelligent aggregation and federated mode.
- **🔒 Security Risks**: Developers running arbitrary MCPs without approval, executing code in non-sandboxed environments, and accessing sensitive resources (databases, cloud APIs) without policies.
- **⚠️ Dangerous Operations**: Database MCPs can delete data, cloud MCPs can delete resources, filesystem MCPs can modify critical files—all without oversight.
- **🔐 No Authentication/Authorization**: Standard MCP has no built-in auth, making it unsuitable for multi-user or enterprise scenarios.

**MCP Federation Gateway solves these problems** by acting as a centralized, policy-enforced gateway for all MCP interactions.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔄 Federation & Aggregation

Combines multiple downstream MCP servers into a single, unified interface. Configure each server independently with its own mode, transport, and settings.

### 🛣️ Intelligent Routing

Automatically dispatches tool calls and resource requests to the correct downstream server based on:

- Tool name prefixes (Direct Mode)
- Meta-tool parameters (Federated Mode)
- Server configuration

### 🔌 Dual-Transport Architecture

**Local (Stdio)**:

- Perfect for development and integration with desktop AI clients (Claude Desktop, etc.)
- Zero network overhead
- Simple configuration

**Remote (HTTP/SSE)**:

- **Enterprise-ready**: Deploy as a centralized gateway for all AI agents in your organization
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Control who can access which MCPs and tools
- **Policy Enforcement**: Validate tool calls before execution, prevent dangerous operations
- **Audit & Compliance**: Log all MCP interactions for security and compliance
- **Cost Optimization**: Centralized context management reduces token consumption across all agents

### 🧠 Two Operating Modes (Per-Server Configurable)

#### **Direct Mode** (Default)

- **What it does**: Exposes all tools from the downstream server directly in the gateway's tool list
- **Tool naming**: Adds server name prefix to prevent collisions (e.g., `weather_get_forecast`, `database_query`)
- **Context impact**: Full tool documentation included in LLM context
- **Best for**: Small number of servers, frequently-used tools, when you want LLM to see all available tools upfront
- **Example**: Weather service, calculator, simple utilities

#### **Federated Mode**

- **What it does**: Hides specific tools from the main tool list, provides access via meta-tools
- **Context impact**: **Massive reduction** (up to 40% token savings) - only meta-tool docs in context, not individual tools
- **Access method**: Use `how_to_use(server_name, topic)` to get docs, `call(server_name, tool_name, args)` to invoke
- **Best for**: Large MCP servers with many tools, rarely-used tools, complex documentation
- **Example**: Database MCP with 50+ tools, cloud provider MCPs, complex agent frameworks

#### **How the Tool List is Formed**

When an AI agent queries `tools/list`, the gateway returns:

1. **All Direct Mode tools** with prefixes:

   - `weather_get_forecast` (from weather server in Direct Mode)
   - `calc_add` (from calculator server in Direct Mode)

2. **Meta-tools** (always included):

   - `how_to_use(mcp_server_name, topic)` - Get documentation for any Federated Mode server
   - `call(mcp_server_name, tool_name, args)` - Invoke any tool on any Federated Mode server

3. **Federated Mode tools are NOT listed** - they're accessed dynamically via meta-tools, keeping context lean

**Example Configuration**:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "weather",
      "mode": "direct",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "arguments": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-weather"]
    },
    {
      "name": "database",
      "mode": "federated",
      "transport": "http",
      "url": "https://db-mcp.internal.company.com/sse"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result**: Agent sees `weather_get_forecast`, `how_to_use`, `call` in tool list. Database tools (potentially 50+) are hidden, accessed only when needed via `call("database", "query", {...})`.

### 🚀 Native AOT Performance

Compiled to native code for ultra-fast startup and minimal footprint. Perfect for serverless and containerized deployments.

### ⚙️ Hierarchical Configuration

Merges global user defaults with workspace-specific configurations. Enterprise admins can set organization-wide policies while allowing workspace customization.

### 🔮 Future Enterprise Features (Roadmap)

- **Policy Engine**: Define rules like "database delete operations require approval" or "cloud resource modifications only in dev environment"
- **Authentication**: OAuth2, API keys, JWT tokens for secure access
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and control costs
- **Sandboxing**: Run untrusted MCPs in isolated containers
- **Central MCP Registry**: Discover and install approved MCPs from organization catalog
- **Usage Analytics**: Track token consumption, tool usage, and costs per user/team

## 🛠️ Meta-Tools

In **Federated Mode**, the gateway exposes two primary tools to interact with the entire ecosystem:

| Tool         | Description                                                                                                 |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `how_to_use` | Provides documentation, summaries, and usage guides for a specific federated MCP server using the host LLM. |
| `call`       | Dynamically invokes any tool on any federated server by specifying `server_name` and `tool_name`.           |

---

### 🚀 Running with DNX

The `McpFederationGateway` is designed to be executed using **dnx**, a lightweight runner for .NET-based MCP servers.

```bash
# To run the latest preview version from NuGet
dnx MicroAgents.McpFederationGateway --transport stdio

# To run a specific version
dnx MicroAgents.McpFederationGateway@0.1.0-preview --transport stdio

# Alternative: Install as a global .NET tool
dotnet tool install -g MicroAgents.McpFederationGateway --version 0.1.0-preview
McpFederationGateway --transport stdio
```

For development and local execution from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MicroAgentsNet/McpFederationGateway.git
cd McpFederationGateway

# Run using dotnet run
dotnet run --project src/McpFederationGateway -- --transport stdio
```

### Configuration

The gateway looks for configuration in `~/.microagents/config.json` and local workspace roots.

**Example `config.json`**:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "weather",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "mode": "direct",
      "command": "npx",
      "arguments": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-weather"]
    },
    {
      "name": "complex-agent",
      "transport": "http",
      "mode": "federated",
      "url": "https://mcp.example.com/sse"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 📐 Architecture

Built on the official [MCP C# SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk), the gateway uses a decoupled DI-based architecture:

- **AggregationService**: Discovers and merges downstream capabilities.
- **RouterService**: Handles protocol-level dispatching and tool mapping.
- **McpClientFactory**: Manages the lifecycle of standard and SSE transports.
- **ConfigurationService**: Handles the hierarchical merging of user and root settings.
